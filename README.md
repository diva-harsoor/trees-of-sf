# About Trees of SF

I started building this app because I loved that games like Pikmin Go got me outside and taught me about nature but hated that they still kept me staring at my phone. Trees of SF encourages users to interact with and learn about real trees in the beautiful city of San Francisco. Learn how to identify trees by key characteristics like leaves, flowers, and bark. As you identify more types of trees you'll be able to say hello to old friends and add new ones to your running collection.

App is currently hosted at [trees-of-sf.vercel.app](trees-of-sf.vercel.app).
